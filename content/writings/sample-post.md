# Welcome to Markdown Writing

This is a sample post written in **markdown**. You can use all the standard markdown features:

## Code Examples

Here's some inline `code` and a code block:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Lists

- Bullet point one
- Bullet point two
  - Sub-item
  - Another sub-item

1. Numbered list
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Images

You can add images by placing them in the `public/images/` folder and referencing them:

![Alt text](/images/your-image.jpg)

Images will be automatically responsive and fit within the content width.

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. It looks nice and minimal.
> 
> You can have multiple paragraphs in blockquotes too.
